# Happy Day

MERN stack app

## About The Project

Happy Day is a full stack web application where you can add your friends and family birthdays or important anniversaries and the app will send you an email notification and/or a push notification to your browser (you need to activate this feature in the settings menu). The backend api also sends notifications to the [mobile app version](https://github.com/nicodeheza/happy-day-native)
